## Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build an interactive claw machine experience in sparkAR. The idea is that users can control the claw by using their face movements instead of their hands. When they feel they get the right position, they can drop the claw by opening the mouth. If the users succeed in catching the toys, they will be rewarded by dressing up the accessories that they caught.
